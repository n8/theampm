theampm
===========

This code is so simple I debated even creating a gem for it, but I find myself creating it over and over again.

With theampm, write time like this in Ruby: 

```ruby
1.am

130.am

4.pm

1515.to_time
```


Installation
------------

1. Add `gem 'theampm'` to your Gemfile.
2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Restart your server
